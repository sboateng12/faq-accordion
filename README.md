## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is my very first code with Javascript and it was overwhelming

### Continued development

I'd like to develop on my CSS3 and finally move on to Javascript

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand HTML and CSS basics. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
